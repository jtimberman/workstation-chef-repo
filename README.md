This is a Chef repository for the roles, cookbooks and data bags that
I use for configuring my workstations. I maintain this in my free
time. Unsupported/unwarranteed disclaimers apply.

You should read and understand the code in this repository before you
use it. I do not make any effort to preserve your existing settings
or not squash your existing setup. It is assumed that you're familiar
with Chef and can fix basic problems if they come up.

By its very nature, a personal workstation is a personal thing. You
should modify this repository as necessary for your local environment,
preferences and style. I am not taking pull requests for this
repository, however. Make it your own, this is a starting point for
you to build on. The individual cookbooks may have their own
repositories with their own guidelines for contribution if you wish.

It has several cookbooks that are written and supported by Opscode or
other members of the Chef Community. See the individual cookbooks'
metadata and/or README for more information.
